**Computer Vision Security System (INTEL-EAGLE PROJECT)**
Computer Vision is an advancing area in the world of information technology. It has revolutionized image and video analysis across industries. In response to evolving security challenges, the utilization of computer vision technologies has become increasingly imperative. Law enforcement agencies and civilians alike face the need for robust systems to enhance security and prevent crimes. Current methods for suspect identification and vehicle tracking often lack efficiency and real-time capabilities. Hence, the development of a comprehensive Computer Vision Security System is crucial to address these challenges.
Objectives:
1. Unified Interface: Develop a unified interface for both law enforcement users (LEUs) and civilian users (CUs) to access and utilize the computer vision system seamlessly.
2. Facial Recognition and License Plate Identification: Implement advanced facial recognition and license plate identification algorithms to enable accurate and efficient identification of persons of interest (POIs) and license plates of interest (LOIs).
3. Real-time Surveillance: Enable live video feed access for LEUs to perform real-time surveillance, allowing for prompt response to security threats and suspicious activities.
4. Match Detection and Reporting: Implement a robust match detection mechanism to identify potential matches with confidence scores. Enable users to generate comprehensive reports with match details and supporting evidence for further action.
5. Notification System: Develop a real-time notification system to alert users, both LEUs and CUs, about critical events such as high-confidence match detections and suspicious activities.

**Methodology:**
1. User-Centric Design: Begin with a thorough understanding of user requirements and workflows, ensuring the system is tailored to the needs of LEUs and CUs.
2. Algorithm Development: Employ state-of-the-art facial recognition and license plate identification algorithms, leveraging machine learning and deep learning techniques for accuracy and efficiency
3. System Architecture: Design a scalable and modular system architecture to support concurrent access, real-time processing, and seamless integration of new features.
4. Data Management: Implement robust data management functionalities to enable LEUs to manage POIs and LOIs efficiently, including image and detail storage.
5. Real-time Surveillance Integration: Integrate live video feed capabilities into the system, enabling LEUs to access and analyze video streams from designated IP cameras in real-time.
6. Match Detection and Reporting Mechanism: Develop algorithms for match detection with confidence scoring, allowing users to review match details and generate comprehensive reports.
7. Notification System Implementation: Implement a notification system to alert users about critical events, ensuring prompt action and response to security threats.
8. Continuous Improvement: Establish channels for user feedback and system improvement, allowing for continuous adaptation and optimization based on evolving needs and technological advancements.

By adhering to this methodology, the Computer Vision Security System aims to provide an efficient and effective solution for law enforcement and civilians, empowering them with advanced capabilities for security and crime prevention.
